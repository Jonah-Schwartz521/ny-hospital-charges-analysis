### Results Interpretation

The achieved MAE values indicate that on average, the model's predictions deviate from the actual hospital charges by approximately $10,486. This level of accuracy is significant given the complexity and variability of inpatient costs, and it demonstrates the model's practical utility for forecasting and budgeting purposes.

The **Quantile Long + Extended LOS Hybrid** model is the **final deliverable**.
